# Changelog

See the [releases for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/releases) for an up to date list of versions and their release dates.

Scribe-Data tries to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
