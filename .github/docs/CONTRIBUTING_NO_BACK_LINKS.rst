.. _Learning the tech stack:

Learning the tech stack
-----------------------

Scribe is very open to contributions from people in the early stages of
their coding journey! The following is a select list of documentation
pages to help you understand the technologies we use.

Docs for those new to programming:

- `Mozilla Developer Network Learning Area
  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn>`_

  - Doing MDN sections for HTML, CSS and JavaScript is the best ways to
    get into web development!

Python learning docs:

- `Python getting started guide
  <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>`_
- `Python getting started resources
  <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_

.. _Development environment:

Development environment
-----------------------

The development environment for Scribe-Data can be installed via the
following steps:

1. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_
   the `Scribe-Data repo <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data>`_,
   clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   .. note::

      Consider using SSH

      Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below,
      consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH
      allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.

      To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the
      HTTPS URL, ``https://github.com/...``, with the SSH one,
      ``git@github.com:...``.

      - e.g. Cloning now becomes ``git clone
        git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-Data.git``

      GitHub also has their documentation on how to `Generate a new SSH
      key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_
      ðŸ”‘

      .. code:: bash

         # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
         git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Data.git
         # Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
         cd Scribe-Data
         # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
         git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data.git

- Now, if you run ``git remote -v`` you should see two remote
  repositories named:

  - ``origin`` (forked repository)
  - ``upstream`` (Scribe-Data repository)

2. Use `Python venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ to
   create the local development environment within your Scribe-Data
   directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m venv venv  # make an environment venv
      pip install --upgrade pip  # make sure that pip is at the latest version
      pip install -r requirements.txt  # install dependencies

   .. note::

      Feel free to contact the team in the `Data room on Matrix
      <https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeData:matrix.org>`_ if you're having
      problems getting your environment setup!

.. _Issues and projects:

Issues and projects
-------------------

The `issue tracker for Scribe-Data <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_ is the preferred channel for `bug reports <#bug-reports>`_, `features requests <#feature-requests>`_ and `submitting pull requests <#pull-requests>`_. Scribe also organizes related issues into `projects <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/projects>`_.

   .. note::

      Just because an issue is assigned on GitHub doesn't mean that the
      team isn't interested in your contribution! Feel free to write `in
      the issues <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_
      and we can potentially reassign it to you.

Be sure to check the `-next release-
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/labels/-next%20release->`_ and
`-priority- <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/labels/-priority->`_
labels in the `issues <https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_
for those that are most important, as well as those marked `good first
issue
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_
that are tailored for first time contributors.

.. _Bug reports:

Bug reports
-----------

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already
   been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using
   the latest ``main`` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository
   is *definitely* responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work,
  etc)

To make the above steps easier, the Scribe team asks that contributors
report bugs using the `bug report template
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=bug_report.yml>`_,
with these issues further being marked with the `bug
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug>`_
label.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

.. _Feature requests:

Feature requests
----------------

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out
whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When
making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and
further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in
its development. Feature requests are marked with the `feature
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature>`_
label, and can be made using the `feature request
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml>`_
template.

.. _Pull requests:

Pull requests
-------------

Good pull requests - patches, improvements and new features - are the
foundation of our community making Scribe-Data. They should remain
focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all
contributions to this project will be made under `the specified license
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>`_ and
should follow the coding indentation and style standards (`contact us
<https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org>`_ if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request
(implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk
spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might
not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major
additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the `GitHub flow
<https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_ process is
the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout <dev-branch>
      git pull upstream <dev-branch>

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch)
   to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_.

.. note:: 

   The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨

   - `commitlint <https://commitlint.io/>`_ helps write `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_
   - Git's `interactive rebase <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase>`_ cleans up commits.


4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your
   topic branch:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push origin <topic-branch-name>

6. `Open a Pull Request
   <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ with a
   clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

.. _Data edits:

Data edits
----------

.. note::

   Please see the `Wikidata and Scribe Guide
   <https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/WIKIDATAGUIDE.md>`_
   for an overview of `Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`_ and how
   Scribe uses it.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they
are sourced from `Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/>`_. Edits can be
discussed and the `Scribe-Data
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data>`_ queries will be changed
and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files,
then the fix should be made on `Wikidata
<https://www.wikidata.org/>`_ and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us
know that edits have been made by `opening an issue
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues>`_ and we'll be happy
to integrate them!

.. _Documentation:

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for Scribe-Data can be found at `scribe-data.readthedocs.io
<https://scribe-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Documentation is an
invaluable way to contribute to coding projects as it allows others to
more easily understand the project structure and contribute. Issues
related to documentation are marked with the `documentation
<https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/labels/documentation>`_
label.

Use the following commands to build the documentation locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   make html

You can then open ``index.html`` within ``docs/build/html`` to check the
local version of the documentation.
